   "response_english": "Committing identity theft is a serious crime that involves unauthorized access to personal information for use for financial or other purposes. This crime is carried out by:\n\n1. **Acquiring Personal Information**: This crime targets individuals who have personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers or even their documentation.\n\n2. **Inquiry**: Usually information is obtained by inquiring from fake correspondence or emails, or by using techniques to hack systems, or by looking at decisions or trash cans (a process known as \"dumpster diving\").\n\n3. **Fraud**: After obtaining personal information, it is used to pressure the victim to release other financial information. This may involve forging the victim's identity in electronic payment or credit transactions.\n\n4. **Developing Fake Identity**: The generated information is then used to form a fake identity. These fake identities can be used to enter credit requests, to obtain new credit cards, or even to present treason bonds in the names of victims.\n\n5. **Fraud**: The victim can be discovered when receiving correspondence from credit companies or deeds from a fake identity. The victim may be accused of practicing the crime if they cannot prove their identity.\n\n**How can it be prevented?**\n\n1. **Protect Personal Information**: Everyone must be careful in sharing personal information such as credit card numbers or account information with others. Documents containing personal information must be deposited in a safe place.\n\n2. **Do not respond to fake emails**: The victim must be wary of fake emails asking for personal or financial information. Stopping is often done by reviewing the message to look for unnoticed quotation marks, or by envied examination.\n\n3. **Developing elusive identities**: The victim must build elusive identities, such as using long and complex passwords and entering them into a secure computer.\n\n4. **Warning of annoyers**: If the victim discovers that they are a victim of identity theft, they should report the crime immediately to local police or the FBI.",
